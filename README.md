# Django-blog

## About The Project 📝

Talking Turkey is a blog I made with Django,Javascript,HTML, and CSS. It is a place where users can visit and view/comment on my thoughts on subjects such as sports,markets,movies, and 
really whatever else I was interested in writing about on a particular day.

You can browse/search topics very easily and leaving a like on a post will save it to your individual profile, making it easier to access if you ever want to go back to it.
